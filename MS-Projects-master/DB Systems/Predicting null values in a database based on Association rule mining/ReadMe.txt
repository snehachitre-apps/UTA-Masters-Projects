*The algorithm for predicting null values in a database based on Assocation rule mining does not use any pre existing algorithm for implementing the concept of Association rule mining.
*The file will return a null value if the minimum confidence value is not met.
*It has been written in Java.
*There are 3 data sets that we are providing for the data to program to be tested on.
*The input file has to be given by the user in the format'filename.csv'
*The output file is generated by the name'out.csv' in the same folder as the program and the data file.
*The program and input file need to be in the same directory for execution.
*The confidence level needs to be around 0.40 to 0.60 for the given data sets.
